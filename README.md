# Laxeron Ash Function

This project is a Shell Script (/system/bin/sh) function library that aims to provide commonly required
functionalities in a portable and easy-to-include manner. The library features a wide range of
functions, each conveniently packaged into specific shell script. The file `function.sh`
encapsulates a complete list of these functions that can be sourced into other shell scripts to
enhance reusability and standardization of code across diverse applications.
